= Kakarot zkEVM

Built atop CairoVM, Kakarot zkEVM provides a bridge between the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Cairo, offering a recognizable abstraction layer for EVM developers.

== The Role of Virtual Machines

A https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/virtual-machine.html[Virtual Machine (VM)] is a software entity emulating a physical computer, running its distinct OS. For example, a virtual MacOS can operate within a physical PC. VMs have become indispensable in cloud contexts, providing resources for various users efficiently.

== Understanding zkEVM

zkEVM emulates the EVM, interpreting high-level languages or bytecodes just like the Ethereum client. It authenticates Ethereum code executions using validity proofs. By condensing transactions into a digest for Ethereum, zkEVM optimizes block space, reducing gas costs and boosting speed.

Given the EVM wasn’t initially designed for zero-knowledge proofs, optimizing zkEVM's efficiency is pivotal for Ethereum’s scalability.

== Degrees of EVM Compatibility

zkEVM's fidelity to Ethereum varies across three categories:

=== Language Equivalence 

Translates EVM bytecode to languages like Cairo optimized for zero-knowledge proof generation. While efficient, transitioning existing EVM tools and protocols poses challenges.

=== Bytecode Equivalence 

These VMs directly interpret EVM bytecode, achieving in-depth Ethereum compatibility. The challenge is EVM’s non-alignment with zero-knowledge proofs, causing inefficiencies.

=== Consensus Equivalence 

The peak of EVM compatibility. Here, zkEVMs don't require Ethereum to re-process cryptographic proofs. Though currently theoretical, Kakarot's team is actively exploring this level of compatibility.

== Dive into Kakarot

Written in Cairo, https://www.kakarot.org/[Kakarot zkEVM] interprets the EVM, enabling verification of Solidity bytecode on Ethereum. It streamlines the development and deployment of EVM applications, offering a platform akin to Ethereum or Polygon.

== Addressing Data Availability

Storing state data on Ethereum ensures user trust, but the high costs necessitate alternatives:

=== Validium:

Stores all state data off-chain to increase transaction throughput.

=== Volition:

Allows users to decide between Ethereum L1 or off-chain storage via a centralized entity.

== Saiyan Chains: L3 zkEVMs

Combining Kakarot and Madara leads to the ability to spawn Kakarot enabled rollups, named Saiyan Chains. Empowering users in a similar way to the [OP-Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/) or the [Polygon CDK](https://polygon.technology/polygon-cdk), Kakarot is echoing Starknet's scaling vision.

== Saiyan Chains’s Role in Scalability

Saiyan Chains facilitates multiple L3 zkEVMs settling on Starknet, enhancing scalability while cutting costs.

== Harnessing Kakarot

=== Migrating Ethereum Contracts to Starknet

With Kakarot's tools, Ethereum-deployed contracts can run on Starknet (or any CairoVM enabled chain) without modifications. This facilitates faster migrations without needing Solidity-to-Cairo conversions.
